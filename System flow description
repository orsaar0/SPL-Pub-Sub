The end-to-end description of our system is simple. Different intelligence sources will deliver info
and ask for a 00 agent (or a couple of them) and a gadget that are needed for some mission.
One of the M-subscribers will process this event, it must know whether the 00 agent is available
in the squad (M cannot perform that check on its own. She will send an event that will be
handled by one of the Moneypenny-subscribers), and whether a fit gadget in his Inventory (as
before, M cannot perform that check on its own. She will send an event that will be handled be
Q). After those checks are made, M fills a report to her diary in case all conditions are met. She
also increments a counter of total received missions (this counter is incremented whether the
mission was executed or not). This should happen while communication between the
Subscribers\Publishers is allowed only via the MessageBroker.
